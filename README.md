# Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol) and GitHub Integration

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a revolutionary standardized protocol that enables AI agents to communicate seamlessly with various tools and services. Think of it like a universal translator:

- **Without MCP**: Each tool speaks its own language, making it difficult for AI agents to integrate with multiple tools.
- **With MCP**: All tools speak the same language, allowing easy integration and communication.

### Real-World Analogy
Imagine having ten expert consultants, each speaking a different language:
- Without MCP: You'd need ten different translators
- With MCP: Everyone speaks a common language, making collaboration effortless

This standardization allows AI agents to:
- Connect to databases
- Interact with GitHub
- Access cloud services
- Manage files and documents
- And much more!

## GitHub MCP Features

```

#### Method 2: Manual Configuration
1. Open `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
2. Add the following configuration:
```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx @smithery/github-mcp --token your_github_token"
    }
  }
}
```

## Finding MCP Servers on Smithery

1. Visit [Smithery](https://smithery.dev)
2. Browse available MCP servers:
   - Filter by category
   - Sort by popularity
   - Search by name or functionality
3. Select "GitHub MCP" from the list
4. Follow installation instructions

## Adding to Cursor
